# ML-coursework
Implemented common machine learning algorithms with numpy

***HW1***

1. Extract TF-IDF vectors from word corpus, filtered fake news using decision tree classifier, got a 76% hit ratio.
2. Implemented Information Gain Algorithm, compared Information Gain and Gini Index as uncertainty metrics of the decision tree.
3. Implemented linear regression with l2 regularizer, and cross-validation from scratch.
4. Performed cross validations on the linear regression model, trained the model by directly solving the weight which resulted in MSE.
5. Compared average cross-validation errors, train errors and test errors.

***HW2***

1. Implemented k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression algorithms.
2. Compute the derivate of the cross entropy loss w.r.t to the weight using the sigmoid activation function.
3. Implemented the backpropagation algorithm and trained a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers to classify the emotion from 16Ã—16 pixels images and achieved a 76.6% average.
